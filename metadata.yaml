description: 'In 1855, when Jose da Fonseca and Pedro Carolino wrote an English phrasebook
  for Portuguese students, they faced just one problem: they didn''t know any English.

  have, though, was a Portuguese-to-French dictionary, and a French-to-English dictionary.

  Carolino''s guide, a Portuguese traveler can insult a barber (""What news tell me?
  All hairs dresser are newsmo.'
